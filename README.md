# LearnChain 🌍  
### AI-Powered Learning Platform with Blockchain Rewards  

LearnChain is an **AI-driven educational platform** that personalizes learning through intelligent mentorship and rewards users with blockchain-based tokens (LCT) for their achievements. It merges **AI**, **education**, and **blockchain** to create a learning experience that is *smart, fun, and rewarding.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

Imagine you have five students in a class — each learns differently.  
LearnChain solves this by letting an **AI Mentor** ask students about their hobbies and then explain lessons using real-world examples tied to their interests.  

After completing a quiz or project, students earn **LearnChain Tokens (LCT)** — a cryptocurrency reward built on the **Solana blockchain**.  
Each course ends with a real-world project to test understanding and inspire innovation.

Learners can track their progress, achievements, and token rewards through an **in-app wallet**, which connects to the Solana network for transparency and withdrawal.
